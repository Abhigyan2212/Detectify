# Detectify
Data Preprocessing and Augmentation
Perform data augmentation using Albumentations or OpenCV:

from albumentations import Compose, Rotate, RandomCrop, HorizontalFlip, VerticalFlip
from albumentations.pytorch import ToTensorV2
import cv2
import os

def augment_image(image, bbox):
    transform = Compose([
        Rotate(limit=15, p=0.5),
        HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
        VerticalFlip(p=0.5),
        RandomCrop(height=512, width=512, p=0.5),
        ToTensorV2(),
    ])
    augmented = transform(image=image, bboxes=[bbox], class_labels=['class_name'])
    return augmented['image'], augmented['bboxes']

 Fine-Tune the YOLO Model
Use the Ultralytics library to fine-tune YOLOv10.

Modify the configuration file to include your dataset paths.

from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pretrained YOLOv10 model
model = YOLO('yolov10.pt')

# Fine-tune the model on the BCCD dataset
model.train(data='BCCD.yaml', epochs=50, imgsz=640)

Model Inference
Write a function to preprocess images and perform inference:

def predict(image_path, model_path='best.pt'):
    model = YOLO(model_path)
    results = model.predict(image_path)
    return results

# Detectify - Object Detection Web App

Detectify is an object detection web application built using a fine-tuned YOLOv10 model. The application allows users to upload images, which are then processed by the model to detect objects. The bounding boxes, predicted class, and confidence score for each detected object are displayed to the user. The app is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for easy access and testing.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
- **BCCD_Dataset/** - Contains the dataset used for training the YOLOv10 model.
- **models/** - Contains scripts for model training, preprocessing, and inference.
  - `train_model.py`: Script to train the model on the BCCD dataset.
  - `preprocess.py`: Preprocessing and data augmentation logic.
  - `inference.py`: Inference logic to predict objects in an image.
- **app_streamlit.py** - Streamlit application that serves as the user interface.
- **requirements.txt** - List of required dependencies to run the project.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhigyan2212/Detectify.git
cd Detectify

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhigyan2212/Detectify.git
cd Detectify
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
.venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Prepare the Dataset
The BCCD_Dataset is included as a submodule. If you haven't cloned it yet, run the following command to get the dataset:

bash
Copy code
git submodule update --init --recursive
Alternatively, you can download the dataset manually from the BCCD Dataset GitHub.

4. Train the Model
To train the YOLOv10 model on the BCCD dataset, run the train_model.py script. The script will fine-tune the model on the dataset.

bash
Copy code
python models/train_model.py
5. Inference
Once the model is trained, you can use the inference.py script to run inference on an image. This script will predict the objects in the image and draw bounding boxes around them.

bash
Copy code
python models/inference.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
6. Run the Web App
To start the web app, run the app_streamlit.py script using Streamlit:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app_streamlit.py
This will open the web app in your browser, where you can upload an image and see the object detection results.

Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces
The app has been deployed on Hugging Face Spaces. You can access the live web application here:

Evaluation Criteria
Precision and Recall: The model performance is evaluated based on precision and recall metrics for each class in the dataset.
Functionality: The web app should correctly accept an image input and display bounding boxes with predicted class and confidence score.
UI/UX: The app interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive.
Code Quality: The code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.
Deployment: The app is successfully deployed on Hugging Face Spaces and is accessible to the public.
